# 🚀 No-Code-Platform for ESP32
🔹 **And the best part?** If you understand my code, you can easily add any featuere you want to esp32 to have and make it happen by directly changing the code.
## 📌 Overview

This platform allows you to control your **ESP32**, manage **TFT Display**, interface with **DHT Sensors**, **MPU6500 series**, and even **older sensors**, while plotting real-time graphs 📊. The entire system is **RTOS-based**, ensuring efficient task management and real-time updates.

### 🔥 Features

- **Real-time control of ESP32** ⏳ *(Max delay: 500ms on AP, varies with external router)*
- **Drag & Drop UI Playground** 🎨 *(No need to write code! Just arrange blocks.)*
- **Graphs for Sensor Readings** 📈 *(View real-time plots of data.)*
- **WiFi Connection & Scanning** 📿 *(Switch between AP & Station mode.)*
- **Minimal Power Testing Mode** 🥪 *(Test with limited features.)*
- **Save and Load Playground**  *(You can save the state of your playground, this will save the blocks in the playground to a JSON file in webserver hosted directory and Load will read that JSON and dynamically appends the original structure of the blocks.So you can load ur projects later on)*


## 📞 ESP32 Setup

### 🌐 WiFi Configuration

1. ESP32 starts as an **Access Point (AP)** with credentials:
   - **SSID:** `esp32-iot`
   - **Password:** `Sai12345` *(You can change this in ****`esp32_main.cpp`****)*
2. The ESP32 AP IP address is **192.168.4.1**.
3. Once connected, send requests via this URL, and ESP32 will respond.
4. If ESP32 switches to **Station Mode (STA)**, it gets a **dynamic IP**. The **current IP** is stored in `/dev/file_esp32_ip.txt` using PHP.

## 🛠 Playground UI

> The **No-Code Playground** is where the magic happens! ✨

The interface is divided into **4 sections**:

- **🛠 Tools** - Essential blocks for controlling ESP32
- **🎮 Playground** - Drag & Drop blocks here to create logic
- **📂 Variables** - View & manage declared variables
- **📊 Graphs** - Click the Graphs icon to visualize sensor data

### 🎯 How It Works

- **Drag blocks** from Tools to Playground. Each block is assigned a class: `playground_element`.
- **Variables update** Variables created by user dynamically updates the **Variables** part every 1 sec using JavaScript.
- **Submit Button** 🔘 triggers a `fetch` request to PHP, which communicates with ESP32 via **POST requests** (No GET requests used!).
- **PHP** 🎥 acts as a bridge between ESP32 and the web client using `cURL`.

---

## 🔗 PHP Server Setup

### 🌍 Local Server for Client

To start a **PHP Server**, run:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

This allows the client to connect and control the ESP32.

### 🗰 ESP32 as a Network Device

To enable the ESP32 to be accessed over a **Local Area Network (LAN)**, i have created this in /wifiConnect folder `esp32_php_server_start.php` in `wifiConnect`:

**Macusers don't have to do it manually, but windows users should either update this code according to there machine which is hosting the php server, or manually set up the server to use the product in LAN**
```php
<?php
if (isset($_POST["ip"]) == 1 && isset($_POST["wifi-set"]) == 1) {
    $ip = shell_exec("ipconfig getifaddr en0 ");
    $ip = preg_replace("/[^a-zA-Z0-9-_\.]/", "", $ip);
    $pid = shell_exec("cd ../ \n php -S $ip:8000 > /dev/null 2>&1 & echo $!");
    header("Location: http://$ip:8000/../esp32_user_control.html");
} else {
    echo "Failed to start php server";
}
```

🔹 This works for **macOS**. Windows users may need to manually adjust the server location.

## 📂 File Structure

- **`/dev`** - Main directory
  - **`/playground`** - Everything about the **drag & drop UI**
  - **`/wifiConnect`** - Handles **WiFi scanning & AP/Station switching**
  - **`/exp`** - Experimental folder *(Ignore it!)*

---

## 📌 Libraries Required

### 🏆 **For MPU6500 I2C**

```bash
arduino-cli lib install "MPU6050_tockn"
arduino-cli lib install "I2Cdev"
```

Supports **MPU6050 & MPU6500**.

### 🖥 **For TFT Display**

```bash
arduino-cli lib install "olikraus/Ucglib@^1.5.2"
```

### 🌧 **For DHT Sensors**

```bash
arduino-cli lib install "adafruit/Adafruit Unified Sensor@^1.1.15"
arduino-cli lib install "adafruit/DHT sensor library@^1.4.6"
```

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

This framework is built to **minimize ESP32 computation** while maximizing **expandability**.

- Want to **add new features**? Just tweak a few lines of code! 🛠️
- **Communication is Serial**: All blocks are **forms** with unique tags; a **universal submit button** processes all requests.
- The **JS response** stores data, updates variables, and plots graphs dynamically!

### 🔄 Visualizing the Process

```
[ESP32]  <--->  [PHP (Server)]  <--->  [JS (Client)]
 |                  |                      |
 |  Handles WiFi    |  Sends & Receives     |  Updates UI, Variables & Graphs
 |  Controls Sensors|  Handles Logic        |  Manages Playground Elements
```

🔹 **How it all connects:**
- The **Playground UI** creates forms representing the logic.
- The **Universal Submit Button** sends data to PHP using **fetch()**.
- **PHP processes** the request and relays it to the **ESP32**.
- **ESP32 executes the command** and **sends back data**.
- PHP then **returns the data to JS**, which updates variables and graphs.

🔹 **And the best part?** You can easily extend it by adding new sensor support or logic blocks without modifying core structures!

🔹 **This is just the beginning!** The No-Code Platform is designed to be scalable and extensible—so go ahead, experiment, and build amazing IoT projects! 🚀
